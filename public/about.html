<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and driven mechanical engineering student specializing in Plant Engineering. My academic journey has been both rewarding and challenging, as I navigate complex subjects such as turbomachinery, vibrations, and heat transfer. I thrive on practical learning, having gained hands-on experience in industrial attachment programs where I worked on vehicle maintenance, HVAC systems, and water treatment plant operations. My curiosity extends beyond engineering—I am deeply interested in web development, ethical hacking, and graphic design, constantly seeking new skills to improve my career prospects</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am an ambitious learner who enjoys problem-solving and exploring ways to generate income through freelancing. I am particularly interested in coding for videos and animations, as well as mastering Excel for data management. My adaptability and determination push me to continuously upskill, whether by taking online courses or diving into self-learning. At the same time, I am committed to ethical practices in all my endeavors, especially in fields like cybersecurity and trading</p>

<p>I am also a creative thinker, always looking for engaging ways to capture attention—whether through content creation for my YouTube Shorts channel or refining my ability to predict and analyze trends in various fields. While I sometimes struggle with motivation and understanding certain subjects, I remain focused on self-improvement and academic success. I believe that with persistence, strategic learning, and the right mindset, I can achieve my goals and establish myself as a well-rounded professional in both engineering and digital innovation.</p>
